# Embrace JavaScript

Browsers have gotten better (standards compliance, JS speed)

Document-based sites were unpopular by JS frameworks, but have kind of won.

Standards/innovation in browsers:
    Canvas
    WebGL
    WebRTC
    IndexedDB
    File and Blob
    raw audio
    raw video
    File System

 Rails is really good at apps that use templates, but much more
 interesting work goes on other than generating HTML.

 Ad-hoc JavaScript starts as "a sprinkle of JavaScript", but ends up being "1Mb sprinkles of JS"

- Done in Discourse:

Omakase Strategy
Cache everything / get very good at caching
Homogenize the cached thing to be generic, use post-processing to decorate

Antipattern: HSON - "Using HTML as a data interchange format to turn it into HTML"
- Incoherent "cache the heck out of it, put some 'data-' attributes on it, tranform it on the client"
