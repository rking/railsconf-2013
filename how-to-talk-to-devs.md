How to Talk to Develers

"It is more important to be interesting than to be informative"

[Note: Slide that said "Sit as close as possible"]

## Law of Demeter

Don't encode structural knowledge within your objects

- Meta stuff:
   * Had the audience do excercises first => Talks have to reach out and grab people. First 30-60 seconds.
   * Hit them with the thesis right up front, then descend in importance down from there (c.f. copy-writing, where writers make it so the editor can chop the end at any length)

## Vim relnum

A bunch of stuff extolling relnum
+ and -
Leader commands
"Don't make activities like committing code a 'leave the editor' activity"
Read vim help

- Meta stuff:
  * Live coding is more interesting than stuff on a slide
  * Hands: Hold up and out, maybe one in pocket


## NIH Syndrome

A company that wrote their own OS, TODO application, mail system, text editor. That company made a "very small" language by minimizing the programming language itself:
- Locals were lower-case letters
- Globals were letters plus numbers
- Functions were terse and not mnemonic, e.g. @LK = read a key
- @ is how you access things
- The code looked like this:

    IF{@v1@CV=1 {@v1|0,O,4}@he^O},
    {IF{{P,{O|0,O|2}@&}@! "";{"* Order blah blah...

 - Meta stuff:
   * People love stories, especially if they're embarrassing, and about you
   * Nerves: Accept its inevitability. @r00k
